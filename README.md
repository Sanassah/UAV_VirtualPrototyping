# Hexacopter Simulation using MATLAB

This repository contains a comprehensive hexacopter simulation implemented in MATLAB. The simulation includes a custom plant model, control allocation algorithm, and various control laws to accurately mimic the behavior of a hexacopter in a virtual environment.

## Features

- Custom Hexacopter Plant: The simulation includes a detailed and customizable hexacopter plant model that takes into account the dynamics and characteristics of a real hexacopter. You can tweak the parameters to match your specific hexacopter configuration.

- Control Allocation: The project incorporates a control allocation algorithm that efficiently distributes control commands to the individual actuators of the hexacopter. This allows for precise control and maneuverability.

- Control Laws: Various control laws have been implemented to govern the hexacopter's behavior. These laws include PID control, trajectory tracking, altitude control, and more. You can experiment with different control laws or even create your own to achieve desired flight characteristics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the hexacopter simulation, you need to have MATLAB installed on your system. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary MATLAB toolboxes for control systems and simulations.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository folder.

3. Open the main simulation script, `hexacopter_simulation.m`, in MATLAB.

4. Modify the simulation parameters and control laws as per your requirements.

5. Run the script to start the hexacopter simulation.

## Usage

The `hexacopter_simulation.m` script serves as the entry point for the simulation. You can modify the script to set up the simulation environment, define initial conditions, and choose the desired control laws.

Once the simulation is running, you can visualize the hexacopter's motion and analyze its behavior using the provided MATLAB plotting functions. You can also collect data for further analysis or performance evaluation.
